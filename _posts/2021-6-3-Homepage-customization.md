This article covers how to style and customize your homepage to match your brand to highlight your store and its products/services more effectively.

Your Homepage/Landing page is the first page your users will get to while accessing your website. It is therefore important to have a good first impression as first impressions tend to be lasting impressions. Luckily, customizing your homepage is a feature baked right into your Namarunu Store website.

Go to your homepage right now, first thing you'll see is a grey hero image covering your entire screen. It has a main title ie New Season, and a sub-title ie First Collection. It also has a shop now button. All this parameters can be changed and adapted to your linking. Take an example of a furniture store, You can add a high quality image of a sofa set, add 'New Designs' as a title and maybe your shop name as the sub title. You can then link the shop now button to that specific sofa or even to a specific category page. You can even add multiple images and they will be a slider about 5 sec each.

To add or edit your homepage slider, go to **your admin panel > store settings > homepage customization**. All your homepage sliders will appear here, if you have none a message will appear instead and the default grey image will be in place. To add a homepage slider, click on the show homepage slider form button to view the form, Add a title, subtitle and choose an image. *For best results, follow the recommended dimensions* Add your custom link and click on submit to save your data. *Note: If you have not yet added any products or categories, you can leave the link param as blank.*
