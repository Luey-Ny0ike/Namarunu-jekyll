<p>Payment integrations in N-store come in multiple ways. There is mpesa stk auto integration and card payments via flutterwave or other 3rd parties.

<p>We do have direct and manual integration for both Mpesa and card straight from the box. This will not be a deep integration so essentially it will just be displaying relevant payment info to the customer, ie a Mpesa till number or bank account number and prompting them a confirmation code. You will then manually approve receiving the payment based on the confirmation code. The main advantage of this is you will not incur any transaction charges beyond those already existing unlike the automated ones which charge upwards of 3% per transaction.</p>

Display Name - The name displayed after/during the payment</p>
