<p>Your Homepage/Landing page is the first page your users will get to while accessing your website. It is therefore important to have a good first impression as first impressions tend to be lasting impressions. Luckily, customizing your homepage is a feature baked right into your Namarunu Store website.</p>

<p>Go to your homepage right now, first thing you’ll see is a grey hero image covering your entire screen. It has a main title ie New Season, and a sub-title ie First Collection. It also has a shop now button. All this parameters can be changed and adapted to your linking. Take an example of a furniture store, You can add a high quality image of a sofa set, add ‘New Designs’ as a title and maybe your shop name as the sub title. You can then link the shop now button to that specific sofa or even to a specific category page. You can even add multiple images and they will be a slider about 5 sec each. You can check one of our Tanzanian clients for inspo <a href="https://www.orcadecotanzania.com">Orcadeco Tanzania</a></p>

<p>To add or edit your homepage slider, go to <strong>your admin panel &gt; store settings &gt; homepage customization</strong>. All your homepage sliders will appear here, if you have none a message will appear instead and the default grey image will be in place. To add a homepage slider, click on the show homepage slider form button to view the form, Add a title, subtitle and choose an image. <em>For best results, follow the recommended dimensions</em> Add your custom link and click on submit to save your data. <em>Note: If you have not yet added any products or categories, you can leave the link param as blank.</em></p>

<p>Just under the homepage slider form, you should see a section called <strong>Featured Homepage Products</strong>. Leave that for now, we shall revisit it under store design once we are done with the getting started course. For now, let’s move to pickup stations/delivery</p>
